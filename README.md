* Plan your moves to hit hard-to-reach bricks and create maximum impact.

# Prerequisites

* Ensure Java JDK 19 is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk19-archive-downloads.html) or any other preferred source
* Internet connection for downloading software and dependencies.

## Step 1: Installing IntelliJ IDEA

   1. Download IntelliJ IDEA:
      * Visit the [JetBrains Website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows) and download the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA (Community or Ultimate Edition).
   
   2. Install IntelliJ IDEA:
      * Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation prompts.

## Step 2: Configuring JavaFX SDK

   1. Download JavaFX SDK:
      * Visit the [OpenJFX Website](https://openjfx.io/) and download the latest JavaFX SDK.
   
   2. Extract JavaFX SDK:
      * Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a desired location on your system.
   
   3. Configure JavaFX in IntelliJ IDEA:
      * Open IntelliJ IDEA.
      * Create a new project or open an existing one.
      * Go to `File > Project Structure > Libraries`.
      * Click the `+` sign and select `Java`.
      * Navigate to the `lib` folder inside the extracted JavaFX SDK directory, select it, and click `OK`.

## Step 3: Setting up JDK in IntelliJ IDEA

   1. Open IntelliJ IDEA:
      * Launch IntelliJ IDEA on your computer.
   
   2. Access Project Structure:
      * If you have a project open, go to `File > Project Structure`.
      * For a new setup without a project, go to `Configure > Project Defaults > Project Structure`.
   
   3. Add JDK 19:
      * In the `Project Structure` dialog, select the `SDKs` under the `Platform Settings`.
      * Click the `+` sign at the top of the pane and select `JDK`.
      * In the file chooser, navigate to the location where JDK 19 is installed on your system and select the JDKâ€™s root directory. IntelliJ IDEA will automatically detect the JDK version.
      * Click `OK` to add JDK 19 to IntelliJ IDEA.

## Step 4: Configuring Your Project to Use JDK 19

   1. Set Project SDK:
      * Still in the `Project Structure` dialog, select `Project` from the left sidebar.
      * In the `Project SDK` section, select the newly added JDK 19 from the dropdown list.
      
   2. Set Project Language Level:
      * In the same `Project` settings, adjust the `Project language level` to match JDK 19. Choose the level that provides the features you need for development.
   
   3. Apply and Close:
      * Click `Apply` and then `OK` to save the changes and close the dialog.

## Step 5: Configuring Maven

   1. Configure Maven in IntelliJ:
      * Go to `File > Settings`.
      * Search for "Maven" and ensure the "Maven home directory" points to the correct installation path.
      
   2. Apply and Confirm:
      * Click `Apply` and `OK` to save the Maven configuration.

## Step 6: Import Maven Dependencies

   1. Open Maven Tool Window:
      * Use the Maven tab in the right sidebar of IntelliJ IDEA.
   
   2. Reimport All Maven Projects:
      * Click the refresh button to reimport all Maven projects. This action downloads and sets up all the necessary dependencies.

### Note: 

* If after reimporting Maven Library/Dependencies, you experience errors & are unable to run the Main.java. Kindly add & re-import the javafx sdk library.

## Step 7: Build and Run the Project

   1. Build the Project:
      * Use IntelliJ IDEA's build feature to compile the project.
   
   2. Run the Application:
      * Execute `Main.java` from the `brickGame.Model` package to start the game.

# Implemented and Working Properly:

1) **Added Background Image**

   - The "Load Game" button is to load the save file from the previous game. This feature is for if the player wishes to pick off where they left off.
   - The "Start New Game" button is to load a new game.
   - The "Exit Game" button is for if the player wishes to exit the game.
 
4) **Added image effects when the ball hits the heart block, deducted heart, bonus ball, and golden ball block**
   
   - PNG images will display according to the power-up which is activated by the player.
   - A minus heart PNG will be displayed in the center of the stage for a brief period with a transition-in & transition-out animation when a heart is deducted.
   - A plus heart PNG will be displayed in the center of the stage for a brief period with a transition-in & transition-out animation when the ball hits the heart block.
   - A bonus PNG will be displayed in the center of the stage for a brief period with a transition-in & transition-out animation when the paddle collects the Bonus ball.
   - A golden ball PNG will be displayed in the center of the stage for a brief period with a transition-in & transition-out animation when the ball hits the star block.
 
5) **Added sound effects when the ball hits the heart block, deducted heart, bonus ball, and golden ball block**
    
    - mp3 sound effects work simultaneously when a power-up is activated by the player.
    - A minus heart sound effect will play briefly when a heart is deducted.
    - A plus heart sound effect will play briefly when the player hits the heart block.
    - A bonus sound effect will play briefly when the player hits the golden ball block.

    - A sound effect will play when the player hovers over a button in the start menu.

# Implemented but Not Working Properly:
     
1) Load Game function
   * The game will skip levels occasionally after loading a saved game and levels may not progress to the next level even though all blocks are hit.
   * Tried to Fix:
      * Tried to implement a modify the checkDestroyedCount method to ensure that when all blocks are hit, it proceeds to the next level.
      * Tried to add a field/variable/method to store the block count in the save file & check with the checkDestroyedCount method so that it will proceed to the next level after hitting the remaining blocks. 
     
2) Save Game function
   * Does not save power-up in the current state.
   * Example: When saving the game that has the golden ball activated. The golden ball will reset to a normal ball after loading the game using the save file.
   * Tired to Fix:
      * Tried to add a golden ball current state in the saveGame method as one of the variables to be saved.

3) Sound Effects
   * The sound effects occasionally do not play at all or play partially.
   * This happens whenever a heart is deducted or the ball hits any special blocks.
   * Tried to Fix:
      * Tried to implement a queue to ensure all soundtracks are played in order & do not crash when multiple sound effects are activated simultaneously.
      * Tried to add better resource handling to load and dispose of each soundtrack after it has been played.

# Features Not Implemented:
1) Special block multiplier (e.g. 2x multiplier)
   * Reason for failure of implementation:
      * No sufficient time to test and implement the feature properly.
     
2) Timer
    * Reason for failure of implementation:
      * No sufficient time to test and implement the feature properly.

3) Use of Mouse to control the paddle
   * Reason for failure of implementation:

## Note:
* If you experience any kind of error (runtime or game freeze). Kindly close & re-run the game.

# Unexpected Problems:
1) JavaFX runtime error (NullExceptionPointer)
     
      * Attempt Fix: Tried initializing all the JavaFX elements, but unfortunately, the error persists.

2) The ball would freeze but the game is playing in the background.
   
      * Attempt Fix: Unable to detect a bug, as there is no error message or warning in the terminal.

3) Sound effects would occasionally be played halfway or not at all.
   
      * Attempt Fix: Tried to add a queue for sound effects so it would not class but the bug persists.

4) The game would end randomly crashing when the ball hit the bottom, causing the heart to be deducted even though the heart counter was many.
   
      * Attempt Fix: Unknown fix. Could not find the root problem.

5) The ball velocity is faster After loading a save game file. Also, the levels would occasionally skip from a certain level to a much higher level.
    
      * Attempt Fix: Tried to save the ball velocity as a variable in the saveGame method but did not work accordingly.
